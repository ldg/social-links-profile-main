## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I used the style guide to set up custom css properties for this project. I did this to ensure that the styles where consistent with the design files. I found this made the actual writing of the code much easier. The additional set up time made the work go much smoother.

### Continued development

A lot of what I get out of these practice projects is just getting comfortable with setting up a project and working with the development tools; setting up my Sass work flow, using the terminal, and trying to be efficient.
